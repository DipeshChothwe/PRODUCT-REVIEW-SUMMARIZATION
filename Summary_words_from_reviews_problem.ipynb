The only thing it lost a star for was the fact that when you have the phone actually in it then it becomes way top heavy. Slide out the keyboard and it just feels off.

It is sleek, seems to mold right into the phone so it looks seamless, etc.  Keys feel fine and even the top row was easy to hit with my large thumbs.  One thing made me stop using it!  When you attach a bluetooth keyboard the autocorrect turns off on your phone!  So no auto correct, not auto capitalization, no auto punctuation!  Now, I am literate enough to type all that properly...but it is so much faster to type a message or text and not have to hit shift all the time, etc.  So...I took off the keyboard and gave it to a friend...learned how to use the flat screen keyboard.  gh 725\n",

            "I have tried the Keyboard Buddy and a couple generic keyboard cases and the Nuu Minikey is, without a doubt, the best one of them all. Not only is it the most elegant by being made to LOOK like a one piece case, it's extremely functional and has a backlight. The bulk added is pretty significant, but in my opinion the iPhone is too thin and flat to be comfortable to hold/use when it's naked. The Minikey has great, BlackBerry-like keys that have good response and a satisfying click when pressed. One thing I'm impressed with is how even though the camera cutout is DEEP, it does NOT affect the flash whatsoever. The backlight is plenty bright as well, and pairing the devices was a breeze. I got lucky and got a brand new one on eBay for only $44.99 shipped, but it's definitely worth the $80 retail price. The only flaw would have to be that the phone becomes a bit top heavy when in the case, but feels just right in the hand since your index fingers naturally hold the iPhone up when typing. This is my favorite iPhone case yet, and if you like texting a lot or writing long emails, the accuracy this keyboard gives you is much worth it.

The only flaw would have to be that the phone becomes a bit top heavy when in the case, but feels just right in the hand since your index fingers naturally hold the iPhone up when typing.

            "suma:   The button layout of this keyboard is great. Definitely prefer it over some phone's keyboards I've had before. The back-light is good and so are the buttons. The only thing it lost a star for was the fact that when you have the phone actually in it then it becomes way top heavy. Slide out the keyboard and it just feels off. All Nuu needs to do is add some extra weight to the keyboard half and this would be perfect.  Moving from a keyboard smartphone to an Iphone I hated the screen keyboard at first.  I bought this and put it on the phone.  It works great!  It is sleek, seems to mold right into the phone so it looks seamless, etc.  Keys feel fine and even the top row was easy to hit with my large thumbs.  One thing made me stop using it!  When you attach a bluetooth keyboard the autocorrect turns off on your phone!  So no auto correct, not auto capitalization, no auto punctuation!  Now, I am literate enough to type all that properly...but it is so much faster to type a message or text and not have to hit shift all the time, etc.  So...I took off the keyboard and gave it to a friend...learned how to use the flat screen keyboard.  trash product big bulky doesn't work on apps  I am currently writing this review on my iphone with the NUU minkikey and while it is faster it is nothing like the blackberry physical keyboard or the droids keyboard. Its flimsy and the keys are hard to press and the lack of auto capitalization makes the whole process more time consuming than it should be. I have to say that having the full screen available while writing this review is amazing! I can think of lots of situations in which the full screen might be really important. With the full screen available I could edit documents and utilize notetaking on my iphone which really turns it into a workhorse. However I know from using the iphone daily that it dose not have the battery capabilities to hold up to the use of document editing and long email writing. Overall this is a nice keyboard and since I got it as a package deal with the purchase of my iphone on ebay I don't think I will sell it. I do think for the most part I will be using my mophie juice pack plus case over this one.

I have tried the Keyboard Buddy and a couple generic keyboard cases and the Nuu Minikey is, without a doubt, the best one of them all. Not only is it the most elegant by being made to LOOK like a one piece case, it's extremely functional and has a backlight. The bulk added is pretty significant, but in my opinion the iPhone is too thin and flat to be comfortable to hold/use when it's naked. The Minikey has great, BlackBerry-like keys that have good response and a satisfying click when pressed. One thing I'm impressed with is how even though the camera cutout is DEEP, it does NOT affect the flash whatsoever. The backlight is plenty bright as well, and pairing the devices was a breeze. I got lucky and got a brand new one on eBay for only $44.99 shipped, but it's definitely worth the $80 retail price. The only flaw would have to be that the phone becomes a bit top heavy when in the case, but feels just right in the hand since your index fingers naturally hold the iPhone up when typing.

In concept, this is a fantastic idea: a full keyboard that slides out and doubles as a protective shell for the iPhone. In practice, though, it didn't work for me. I didn't like the feel of the keys at all and found this keyboard too difficult to type with. The letters are too flat against the casing and the lack of spacing between keys means it's too easy to accidentally push neighboring letters. Maybe this will improve with time, but as of now, I found it more difficult to use than the onscreen keys. The onscreen keys has spacing.\n",

            "suma:   The button layout of this keyboard is great. Definitely prefer it over some phone's keyboards I've had before. The back-light is good and so are the buttons. The only thing it lost a star for was the fact that when you have the phone actually in it then it becomes way top heavy. Slide out the keyboard and it just feels off. All Nuu needs to do is add some extra weight to the keyboard half and this would be perfect.  Moving from a keyboard smartphone to an Iphone I hated the screen keyboard at first.  I bought this and put it on the phone.  It works great!  It is sleek, seems to mold right into the phone so it looks seamless, etc.  Keys feel fine and even the top row was easy to hit with my large thumbs.  One thing made me stop using it!  When you attach a bluetooth keyboard the autocorrect turns off on your phone!  So no auto correct, not auto capitalization, no auto punctuation!  Now, I am literate enough to type all that properly...but it is so much faster to type a message or text and not have to hit shift all the time, etc.  So...I took off the keyboard and gave it to a friend...learned how to use the flat screen keyboard.  trash product big bulky doesn't work on apps  I am currently writing this review on my iphone with the NUU minkikey and while it is faster it is nothing like the blackberry physical keyboard or the droids keyboard. Its flimsy and the keys are hard to press and the lack of auto capitalization makes the whole process more time consuming than it should be. I have to say that having the full screen available while writing this review is amazing! I can think of lots of situations in which the full screen might be really important. With the full screen available I could edit documents and utilize notetaking on my iphone which really turns it into a workhorse. However I know from using the iphone daily that it dose not have the battery capabilities to hold up to the use of document editing and long email writing. Overall this is a nice keyboard and since I got it as a package deal with the purchase of my iphone on ebay I don't think I will sell it.

I have tried the Keyboard Buddy and a couple generic keyboard cases and the Nuu Minikey is, without a doubt, the best one of them all. Not only is it the most elegant by being made to LOOK like a one piece case, it's extremely functional and has a backlight. The bulk added is pretty significant, but in my opinion the iPhone is too thin and flat to be comfortable to hold/use when it's naked. The Minikey has great, BlackBerry-like keys that have good response and a satisfying click when pressed. One thing I'm impressed with is how even though the camera cutout is DEEP, it does NOT affect the flash whatsoever. The backlight is plenty bright as well, and pairing the devices was a breeze. I got lucky and got a brand new one on eBay for only $44.99 shipped, but it's definitely worth the $80 retail price. The only flaw would have to be that the phone becomes a bit top heavy when in the case, but feels just right in the hand since your index fingers naturally hold the iPhone up when typing. This is my favorite iPhone case yet, and if you like texting a lot or writing long emails, the accuracy this keyboard gives you is much worth it.

I got lucky and got a brand new one on eBay for only $44.99 shipped, but it's definitely worth the $80 retail price. The only flaw would have to be that the phone becomes a bit top heavy when in the case, but feels just right in the hand since your index fingers naturally hold the iPhone up when typing. This is my favorite iPhone case yet, and if you like texting a lot or writing long emails, the accuracy this keyboard gives you is much worth it.

Not only is it the most elegant by being made to LOOK like a one piece case, it's extremely functional and has a backlight.

            "suma:   The button layout of this keyboard is great. Definitely prefer it over some phone's keyboards I've had before. The back-light is good and so are the buttons. The only thing it lost a star for was the fact that when you have the phone actually in it then it becomes way top heavy. Slide out the keyboard and it just feels off. All Nuu needs to do is add some extra weight to the keyboard half and this would be perfect.  Moving from a keyboard smartphone to an Iphone I hated the screen keyboard at first.  I bought this and put it on the phone.  It works great!  It is sleek, seems to mold right into the phone so it looks seamless, etc.  Keys feel fine and even the top row was easy to hit with my large thumbs.  One thing made me stop using it!  When you attach a bluetooth keyboard the autocorrect turns off on your phone!  So no auto correct, not auto capitalization, no auto punctuation!  Now, I am literate enough to type all that properly...but it is so much faster to type a message or text and not have to hit shift all the time, etc.  So...I took off the keyboard and gave it to a friend...learned how to use the flat screen keyboard.  trash product big bulky doesn't work on apps  I am currently writing this review on my iphone with the NUU minkikey and while it is faster it is nothing like the blackberry physical keyboard or the droids keyboard. Its flimsy and the keys are hard to press and the lack of auto capitalization makes the whole process more time consuming than it should be. I have to say that having the full screen available while writing this review is amazing! I can think of lots of situations in which the full screen might be really important. With the full screen available I could edit documents and utilize notetaking on my iphone which really turns it into a workhorse. However I know from using the iphone daily that it dose not have the battery capabilities to hold up to the use of document editing and long email writing. Overall this is a nice keyboard and since I got it as a package deal with the purchase of my iphone on ebay I don't think I will sell it. I do think for the most part I will be using my mophie juice pack plus case over this one.

I have tried the Keyboard Buddy and a couple generic keyboard cases and the Nuu Minikey is, without a doubt, the best one of them all. Not only is it the most elegant by being made to LOOK like a one piece case, it's extremely functional and has a backlight. The bulk added is pretty significant, but in my opinion the iPhone is too thin and flat to be comfortable to hold/use when it's naked. The Minikey has great, BlackBerry-like keys that have good response and a satisfying click when pressed. One thing I'm impressed with is how even though the camera cutout is DEEP, it does NOT affect the flash whatsoever. The backlight is plenty bright as well, and pairing the devices was a breeze. I got lucky and got a brand new one on eBay for only $44.99 shipped, but it's definitely worth the $80 retail price. The only flaw would have to be that the phone becomes a bit top heavy when in the case, but feels just right in the hand since your index fingers naturally hold the iPhone up when typing.

I have tried the Keyboard Buddy and a couple generic keyboard cases and the Nuu Minikey is, without a doubt, the best one of them all. Not only is it the most elegant by being made to LOOK like a one piece case, it's extremely functional and has a backlight. The bulk added is pretty significant, but in my opinion the iPhone is too thin and flat to be comfortable to hold/use when it's naked. The Minikey has great, BlackBerry-like keys that have good response and a satisfying click when pressed. One thing I'm impressed with is how even though the camera cutout is DEEP, it does NOT affect the flash whatsoever. The backlight is plenty bright as well, and pairing the devices was a breeze. I got lucky and got a brand new one on eBay for only $44.99 shipped, but it's definitely worth the $80 retail price. The only flaw would have to be that the phone becomes a bit top heavy when in the case, but feels just right in the hand since your index fingers naturally hold the iPhone up when typing. This is my favorite iPhone case yet, and if you like texting a lot or writing long emails, the accuracy this keyboard gives you is much worth it.

Its flimsy and the keys are hard to press and the lack of auto capitalization makes the whole process more time consuming than it should be. I have to say that having the full screen available while writing this review is amazing! I can think of lots of situations in which the full screen might be really important. With the full screen available I could edit documents and utilize notetaking on my iphone which really turns it into a workhorse. However I know from using the iphone daily that it dose not have the battery capabilities to hold up to the use of document editing and long email writing. Overall this is a nice keyboard and since I got it as a package deal with the purchase of my iphone on ebay I don't think I will sell it.

I have tried the Keyboard Buddy and a couple generic keyboard cases and the Nuu Minikey is, without a doubt, the best one of them all. Not only is it the most elegant by being made to LOOK like a one piece case, it's extremely functional and has a backlight. The bulk added is pretty significant, but in my opinion the iPhone is too thin and flat to be comfortable to hold/use when it's naked. The Minikey has great, BlackBerry-like keys that have good response and a satisfying click when pressed. One thing I'm impressed with is how even though the camera cutout is DEEP, it does NOT affect the flash whatsoever. The backlight is plenty bright as well, and pairing the devices was a breeze. I got lucky and got a brand new one on eBay for only $44.99 shipped, but it's definitely worth the $80 retail price. The only flaw would have to be that the phone becomes a bit top heavy when in the case, but feels just right in the hand since your index fingers naturally hold the iPhone up when typing. This is my favorite iPhone case yet, and if you like texting a lot or writing long emails, the accuracy this keyboard gives you is much worth it.

In concept, this is a fantastic idea: a full keyboard that slides out and doubles as a protective shell for the iPhone. In practice, though, it didn't work for me. I didn't like the feel of the keys at all and found this keyboard too difficult to type with. The letters are too flat against the casing and the lack of spacing between keys means it's too easy to accidentally push neighboring letters.

            "suma:   The button layout of this keyboard is great. Definitely prefer it over some phone's keyboards I've had before. The back-light is good and so are the buttons. The only thing it lost a star for was the fact that when you have the phone actually in it then it becomes way top heavy. Slide out the keyboard and it just feels off. All Nuu needs to do is add some extra weight to the keyboard half and this would be perfect.  Moving from a keyboard smartphone to an Iphone I hated the screen keyboard at first.  I bought this and put it on the phone.  It works great!  It is sleek, seems to mold right into the phone so it looks seamless, etc.  Keys feel fine and even the top row was easy to hit with my large thumbs.  One thing made me stop using it!  When you attach a bluetooth keyboard the autocorrect turns off on your phone!  So no auto correct, not auto capitalization, no auto punctuation!  Now, I am literate enough to type all that properly...but it is so much faster to type a message or text and not have to hit shift all the time, etc.  So...I took off the keyboard and gave it to a friend...learned how to use the flat screen keyboard.  trash product big bulky doesn't work on apps  I am currently writing this review on my iphone with the NUU minkikey and while it is faster it is nothing like the blackberry physical keyboard or the droids keyboard.

I have to say that having the full screen available while writing this review is amazing! I can think of lots of situations in which the full screen might be really important. With the full screen available I could edit documents and utilize notetaking on my iphone which really turns it into a workhorse. However I know from using the iphone daily that it dose not have the battery capabilities to hold up to the use of document editing and long email writing.

The bulk added is pretty significant, but in my opinion the iPhone is too thin and flat to be comfortable to hold/use when it's naked. The Minikey has great, BlackBerry-like keys that have good response and a satisfying click when pressed. One thing I'm impressed with is how even though the camera cutout is DEEP, it does NOT affect the flash whatsoever. The backlight is plenty bright as well, and pairing the devices was a breeze. I got lucky and got a brand new one on eBay for only $44.99 shipped, but it's definitely worth the $80 retail price. The only flaw would have to be that the phone becomes a bit top heavy when in the case, but feels just right in the hand since your index fingers naturally hold the iPhone up when typing. This is my favorite iPhone case yet, and if you like texting a lot or writing long emails, the accuracy this keyboard gives you is much worth it.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone.

I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you.

But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge.

This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone!  Product met all expectations  purchased for my Mom for mothers day. Its great for those who are not too smart phone savy! a great introduction phone purchased for my Mom for mothers day.

Works with tmobile, go smart, metro pcs, bright spot, ultra mobile, and other companies that run on tmobile. It's good to use as a starter phone or as a temporary one and is really worth the price.  I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

One more thing, she doesn't really let or like to let anyone borrow it for phone calls unless she duals their phone number for them and puts I on speaker so nobody would drop it and ruin it.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is. I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it.

Works with tmobile, go smart, metro pcs, bright spot, ultra mobile, and other companies that run on tmobile. It's good to use as a starter phone or as a temporary one and is really worth the price.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

This was a gift I purchased for my little sister and she's so alert about treating it good BC she never had a phone with a white phone color as the back of the phone and she says she can do or lol for everything she wants asap on the phone n she doesn't want to ruin it so she tries to take good care of it n treats it gently. One more thing, she doesn't really let or like to let anyone borrow it for phone calls unless she duals their phone number for them and puts I on speaker so nobody would drop it and ruin it.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you. This review is simply about the transitioning from iPhone or Android to the new Windows format.\n",
            "\n",
            "  Firstly, If you DO NOT already use Windows 8 or 8.1 on your personal computer, before buying this phone, you will have a few problems with it. Hence, AMOST ALL of the bad reviews of these phones where by people who do not use a windows 8/8.1 machine. Meaning the new windows format is a little difficult to understand. But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone. But, that is just my opinion!\n",
            "\n",
            "  However if you DO use windows 8/8.1 on your personal computer, you will have a much easier time with the transition from iPhone or Android to the Windows Operating system on a cell phone.\n",
            "  Personally, I do use Windows 8.1 on my Laptop. So it was a WAY easier of a transition to this phone. Oh! and for the IPhone and Android people: At the least, this Windows phone  IS  A LOT FASTER!!!\n",
            "\n",
            "  Yes, this windows phone has some issues (the annoying type), But so does the windows Operating Systems on computers! But, like every new product on the market, There are adjustments that need to be made (Also known as UPDATES!!!).\n",
            "\n",
            "  I've had this phone for about 3 weeks now. But, The bugs are being worked out already. When I fist received the phone, I notice a few glitches(Like being kicked off of the internet while browsing.) But, after doing the updates a couple of times, It stopped kicking me off. So, the fixes are in progress.\n",
            "  If you are a die hard windows 7 or Vista user, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED BY THIS PHONE! It is nothing like the operating systems of old.\n",
            "\n",
            "  In Closing, My suggestion would be to try using windows 8/8.1 for a while (Like 2 weeks or so), If you like it, you should have very few issues with the new phones.\n",
            "  If you think this is just a fad, and refuse to upgrade yourself. Then you will be left behind like the NOW OBSOLETE WINDOWS XP!!! Yes windows XP was a good operating system. It has run is life course and is now time to bury it! It is called Progress People!!!\n",
            "\n",
            "  Just remember, If you are getting this phone, DO THE UPDATES!!! It will fix most of its issues.\n",

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).

            "I've only had the phone for a few days, but this is how I feel about it so far. I'm happy with it for the price I paid.  This was a gift I purchased for my little sister and she's so alert about treating it good BC she never had a phone with a white phone color as the back of the phone and she says she can do or lol for everything she wants asap on the phone n she doesn't want to ruin it so she tries to take good care of it n treats it gently. One more thing, she doesn't really let or like to let anyone borrow it for phone calls unless she duals their phone number for them and puts I on speaker so nobody would drop it and ruin it. She treats it as good as she treats her 3 month old baby.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is. I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is. I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised.

The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is. I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is. I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is.  Not bad.  Could get better phone with same price  Fast shipping  For a phone under $50, it performs great!

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you.

But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you.

Hence, AMOST ALL of the bad reviews of these phones where by people who do not use a windows 8/8.1 machine. Meaning the new windows format is a little difficult to understand. But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it.

The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it.

Works with tmobile, go smart, metro pcs, bright spot, ultra mobile, and other companies that run on tmobile. It's good to use as a starter phone or as a temporary one and is really worth the price.  I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you.

But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it.

Works with tmobile, go smart, metro pcs, bright spot, ultra mobile, and other companies that run on tmobile. It's good to use as a starter phone or as a temporary one and is really worth the price.

There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.  I will not venture so far as to say it was the user, but... .\n",

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you. This review is simply about the transitioning from iPhone or Android to the new Windows format.\n",
            "\n",
            "  Firstly, If you DO NOT already use Windows 8 or 8.1 on your personal computer, before buying this phone, you will have a few problems with it. Hence, AMOST ALL of the bad reviews of these phones where by people who do not use a windows 8/8.1 machine. Meaning the new windows format is a little difficult to understand. But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone. But, that is just my opinion!\n",
            "\n",
            "  However if you DO use windows 8/8.1 on your personal computer, you will have a much easier time with the transition from iPhone or Android to the Windows Operating system on a cell phone.\n",
            "  Personally, I do use Windows 8.1 on my Laptop. So it was a WAY easier of a transition to this phone. Oh! and for the IPhone and Android people: At the least, this Windows phone  IS  A LOT FASTER!!!\n",
            "\n",

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you. This review is simply about the transitioning from iPhone or Android to the new Windows format.\n",

            "  Firstly, If you DO NOT already use Windows 8 or 8.1 on your personal computer, before buying this phone, you will have a few problems with it. Hence, AMOST ALL of the bad reviews of these phones where by people who do not use a windows 8/8.1 machine. Meaning the new windows format is a little difficult to understand. But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone. But, that is just my opinion!\n",

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.

This was a gift I purchased for my little sister and she's so alert about treating it good BC she never had a phone with a white phone color as the back of the phone and she says she can do or lol for everything she wants asap on the phone n she doesn't want to ruin it so she tries to take good care of it n treats it gently.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is. I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is. I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised.

I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is. I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you.

But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is. I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you.

But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money. If you want a high end device do not look at this phone this is not what this is.  Not bad.  Could get better phone with same price  Fast shipping  For a phone under $50, it performs great!

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it. I find it ridiculous that people want a higher resolution than a computer or a tv for their phone! I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need.

I have read most of the reviews that I could find about this phone (Which actually helped), before I purchased it. So, this might be a little lengthy for some of you. This review is simply about the transitioning from iPhone or Android to the new Windows format.\n",

But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

But, When you add a windows OS to a phone, there will be a lot of problems if you don't already use Windows8/8.1 I would suggest that you use a windows 8/8.1 machine for little while before buying this phone.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

            "suma:   It is okay but battery life is not so great. Also, it is missing front facing camera -- that could be major factor for some users. You could probably get much better phone for this price ($98).  Good product  I have used a Nokia Lumia 521 but gave it away to a friend in need. I heard negative things about this phone and I am surprised since this phone is great for the price. I noticed its way faster than the Nokia Lumia 521. The storage is 4gb and I highly recommend using an sd card to store extra photos and apps. This is not for a power user so I recommend it to people don't use a lot of apps (my main apps are whatsapp, viber, and mix radio) and use a phone as a phone. Call quality is good and I have no problems with the touchscreen keyboard. Texting is a breeeze on here with the update on swiping to text. Camera is ok for outdoor photos but for anything else its useless. There is no front camera and no flash so video calling would be a challenge. I take selfies using the wonderful Lumia selfie app. The screen quality is ok and it has the lowest resolution compared to modern day smartphones today, but I don't mind it.

The 530 was a good choice last year, but now it has been replaced by the FAR superior Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE which has high speed data speeds with 4g LTE, dual front and back cameras, a big five inch screen and a long life battery.  Best of all, the 640 LTE costs just $60 at your neighborhood AT&T store or $39 at your neighborhood MetroPcs store.  There is no phone selling for under $100 that comes close in build quality to the 640 LTE.  And, in December, the 640 LTE will receive a free upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, the most advanced phone software available.  I bought this for my wife, because she did not like the 635 (who does?).  We ended up giving it to my son who loves it.  My Bride defected to Android where she learned that her original issues with the 635 and then with the 530 were neither the species nor the specimens.

A  great phone for little money.  I like the phone but it keeps dropping calls. I'm happy with the screen size, but the touch screen is very touchy. I can barely touch and it will call someone. I bought one for my fiancee and his phone freezes and he has to take out the battery to get it moving. All in all it's a good phone for the price.  As advertised.  I was not expecting much, but Im truly surprised. I sell phones for a living so when i had no choice but to grab this thing it was kinda embarassing. I broke my high end Galaxy S5 (no case on it) and since I couldn't wait 4 days for my insurance phone to ship I bought this as my back up. I was utterly surprised you can download Minecraft and it works great on this phone with no lag.  I was truely surprised by that. The screen is not great, but for the price, I am not expecting a 720p screen at this price nor should anyone be for this price. THe pictures come out grainy when taken from too far or too close. I can say that Nokia is giving you a lot for your money though.  You can get e-mails, text, Minecraft, GPS, and watch videos on this phone. Mix Radio is included for free with no commericals on this thing that kind of service usually runs about 3 dollars a month on most apps through apple or android. Needless to say if you looking for a great back up or starter phone for yourself or kids just grab this save yourself the hassle. Any other cheap android phone will just disapoint and tick you off when you find out you could of paid less and gotten more from the Lumia 530. I plan on giving this to my son as soon as my S 5 comes in and would not hesitate to purchase another Lumia though. I truly think your getting a lot for your money.

It comes with a micro usb wire and detailed instructions in legible English with diagrams for those of us that aren't tech savvy. I haven't tested it with my iPhones yet but it appears to be working fine with my Galaxy S4 Qi Charger thru the Otterbox case. Its much easier than dealing with plugging the phone in every time you need to charge it, considering I reach for the device a million times a day. Now I don't have to worry about unplugging the Charger wire then plugging it back in every time I need to use it. Excellent Qi charging Pad and Qi receiver. Recommendable brand and product \n",

I purchased this from Shenzhen BaiYiTong Electronic Co.,LTD. Part installation was pretty easy and straight forward. I really like that adhesive tape was pre-applied in several key areas with the backing left on which really simplified things. There was one piece of tape/insulation I did have to transfer from the old phone ( you can find it on YouTube Videos), but otherwise, everything I needed was included. The included tools are pretty cheaply made, but they did the job. The part itself is working great. It's been installed on my wife's phone for almost a month now with no issues. The screen doesn't have any dead spots or pixels and appears as sharp and crisp as the original with no loss of touch sensitivity.  Had to order 2  Five Stars  Dont knock it till you try it!  It arrived today on time and packaged very nicely. It took me probably 30-45 minutes to install  Four Stars  Easy installation  which is very easy to fix with pocket knife  Five Stars  Cracked at first \n",

Quality is the same as old unit. I was a little nervous after reading the reviews but glad I took the risk. With these things you will never know how good it is until ypu try it yourself. Took my time and was very careful with it and it works fine.  It arrived today on time and packaged very nicely.

I would have to say the tools were a touch subpar, especially the prying tool, but all in all worked just fine. Needless to say my boyfriend is happy to have his favorite phone back and I'll be fixing our other two broken phones myself, like this!

Rhinestones are recessed and won't scratch. A great case for the price with basic shock absorption. Does cover the back microphone on the top by the camera. Wish they could have a version with a kick stand.  This case is actually alright, very cute. But I Did feel like it could have been a tad thinner, since this phone is pretty thin, the rubber it the top and bottom where it meets the surface of the phone seems just a Tad loose or large.

It's not always easy to find a screen protector that goes on clean and doesn't affect your picture or the sensitivity of your touch screen, but this one really does.

This is a really great tempered glass screen protector and I love it! It's made of \"explosion-proof\" real glass and is scratch, water, and crack resistant. It's really durable and strong but at the same time it's also nice and thin so that it goes on your phone smooth and easy and pretty and looks good. It doesn't mess with your touch screen capabilities so everything still works fine and it's really crystal clear. It's not always easy to find a screen protector that goes on clean and doesn't affect your picture or the sensitivity of your touch screen, but this one really does. It has the guide tabs to make it easier to  put on and also the wet and dry professional cleaning wipes to make sure that there's no dust or dirt trapped under the screen protector on your screen. I received this product for free but would happily have purchased something like this because it really is an awesome product.  These covers are infinitely better than the plastic film type covers that essentially stick to a display.  This protector doesn't have the semi-tacky feel of the thinner/cheaper covers - so your finger still \"glides\" over the protector just as it would if it were the bare glass of the screen itself.  It is certainly more protective as well - as it is obviously considerably thicker than the thin sheet style protectors.  Overall - a very good protector.  Like all protectors, you'll need to be careful applying it to ensure a bubble-free installation.  I did it in my bathroom with it good and steamed up - and made sure every last speck of dust was off the screen.

            "I have received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All reviews are 100 percent my own words, thoughts and experience.  This is a really great tempered glass screen protector and I love it! It's made of \"explosion-proof\" real glass and is scratch, water, and crack resistant. It's really durable and strong but at the same time it's also nice and thin so that it goes on your phone smooth and easy and pretty and looks good. It doesn't mess with your touch screen capabilities so everything still works fine and it's really crystal clear. It's not always easy to find a screen protector that goes on clean and doesn't affect your picture or the sensitivity of your touch screen, but this one really does. It has the guide tabs to make it easier to  put on and also the wet and dry professional cleaning wipes to make sure that there's no dust or dirt trapped under the screen protector on your screen. I received this product for free but would happily have purchased something like this because it really is an awesome product.  These covers are infinitely better than the plastic film type covers that essentially stick to a display.  This protector doesn't have the semi-tacky feel of the thinner/cheaper covers - so your finger still \"glides\" over the protector just as it would if it were the bare glass of the screen itself.  It is certainly more protective as well - as it is obviously considerably thicker than the thin sheet style protectors.  Overall - a very good protector.  Like all protectors, you'll need to be careful applying it to ensure a bubble-free installation.  I did it in my bathroom with it good and steamed up - and made sure every last speck of dust was off the screen.  This protector - as it isn't flexible like the thin ones - I simply set one corner down for alignment and basically dropped the rest onto the screen and it sort of sucks itself on.  Easiest install ever, really.\n",
            "\n",
            "UPDATE: 8/10/2016\n",
            "Apparently the product itself changed (see photos) - where the protector follows the top speaker and front facing camera is different as is where the protector outlines the home button.  Additionally, the \"new\" version of this protector is too wide and thus does not sit on the slightly contoured glass of the Note 4.  In the photos is my phone with a case - and the Shockwise protector I ordered 3 months ago (June 2016).  The Note 4 without the case is my sons - with the \"new\" version of the protector - clearly showing it flat doesn't fit.  Not sure if they changed the source or what but the protector I love on my phone is now apparently no longer the one you'll get for the Note 4.\n",
            "\n",
            "Keep in mind that due to the Note 4 (and up) screen shape with rounded edges, this rigid protector does not (cannot) go *all* the way to the edges of the screen.  Stupid rounded edges anyway :-/  This item is great. I really like it. It fits my phone perfect. Was very easy to apply and you can't even tell that it's there. Thank you for allowing me to review this item for free. I will definatly recommend this product to others. Thank you.  This is my first tempered glass screen protector vs. conventional film screen protectors that I've used to.\n",

I drop my note 4 all the time so i was in need of something to help protect it from breaking since i keep everything on my phone. I received this from seller review to try and so far it is doing just what it was made to do protect my phone.  The screen protector was easy to install and fit perfectly.  Works really well. East to install. I had to take it off and put it back on to realign and still have no bubbles  Excellent product.  Easy install no bubbles.  Does not affect visual quality and touch sensitivity is not affected.  Seems to repel fingerprints.\n",

            "I bought another one since my previous saved my phone by taking a large drop!  I would recommend this product 10/10  Received this product as a gift.  Wife had just cracked another product.  This ShockWize went on with no problem, easy to open package and feels even sturdier than her previous, and bubble free for sure!..  I purchase this product again!  This is my second one of these and they definitely save your screen!  The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Ballistic Screen Protector ShockWize [Tempered Glass] , is the best addition to my phone I could have asked for.  It was easy to install and feel does not fell weird when I use my phone.  I currently have Original Tempered Glass on my note 4. By comparison, both has the same size.  It doesn't cover the entire phone screen. It left 1/8 of the inch open all sides. The cut out is not precise to the Note 4. Example: the cut out for the home key at the bottom and on the top is for the earpiece and proximity and light sensors. The camera part isn't cut out.  No streak or fingerprint mark on the screen which is a plus.  If you want protection and don't care about detail/perfection then this one is for you but for me, the cut out is the only drawback. FYI. I got this for free.  the screen does not cover the entire viewing area of the screen, there is a hairline around the entire screen that is not covered,\n",
            "the reply from the seller, was it was by design that they do not cover the entire screen to avoid issues with cases, but i have yet to see a case that covers the screen.\n",
            "it'll do until it breaks.  I love these ballistic glass screen protectors  Tempered Glass Screen Protector  *WAS* Great Protection - until they changed the design.  This item is great.

            "Would buy it if the item came in black.  cannot distinguish between volume and power buttons. such a cute color but  minimal coverage.  Bought this for the girlfriend's phone. She loves it, no complaints.  Fit perfect like a lot... Thanks  Great case for the price. Also was shipped pretty fast. That's was great since I just got my Nexus 6, didn't want to damage my phone in any way. Only thing is it is hard to tell what the buttons are on the side. Oh well gonna have to get use to it.  Nice case. Fits perfectly and feels good in the hand. Much better grip for my phone. The only thing that I can complain about is the buttons. I can't distinguish the power from the volume.

Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good.  I really like it.  It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.  The hole cut to display the Motorola logo does help keep a handle on it, and I AM done looking for a case (now, after 3).  If you don't have chronic dry hands like I do, you probably won't have a problem at all with it.  Anyway, my only other complaint with this case (as it was with the previous 2 cases - both from Orzly) is that it's nearly impossible to find the power and volume buttons by feel alone.  If they could just put a little bump or line on the darn button, I would be so grateful. I really like it.

She loves it, no complaints.  Fit perfect like a lot... Thanks  Great case for the price. Also was shipped pretty fast. That's was great since I just got my Nexus 6, didn't want to damage my phone in any way. Only thing is it is hard to tell what the buttons are on the side. Oh well gonna have to get use to it.  Nice case. Fits perfectly and feels good in the hand. Much better grip for my phone. The only thing that I can complain about is the buttons. I can't distinguish the power from the volume.

Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good.  I really like it.  It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.  The hole cut to display the Motorola logo does help keep a handle on it, and I AM done looking for a case (now, after 3).  If you don't have chronic dry hands like I do, you probably won't have a problem at all with it.  Anyway, my only other complaint with this case (as it was with the previous 2 cases - both from Orzly) is that it's nearly impossible to find the power and volume buttons by feel alone.  If they could just put a little bump or line on the darn button, I would be so grateful. I really like it.

It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.  The hole cut to display the Motorola logo does help keep a handle on it, and I AM done looking for a case (now, after 3).  If you don't have chronic dry hands like I do, you probably won't have a problem at all with it.  Anyway, my only other complaint with this case (as it was with the previous 2 cases - both from Orzly) is that it's nearly impossible to find the power and volume buttons by feel alone.

It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.  The hole cut to display the Motorola logo does help keep a handle on it, and I AM done looking for a case (now, after 3).  If you don't have chronic dry hands like I do, you probably won't have a problem at all with it.

            "Would buy it if the item came in black.  cannot distinguish between volume and power buttons. such a cute color but  minimal coverage.  Bought this for the girlfriend's phone. She loves it, no complaints.  Fit perfect like a lot... Thanks  Great case for the price. Also was shipped pretty fast. That's was great since I just got my Nexus 6, didn't want to damage my phone in any way. Only thing is it is hard to tell what the buttons are on the side. Oh well gonna have to get use to it.  Nice case. Fits perfectly and feels good in the hand. Much better grip for my phone. The only thing that I can complain about is the buttons. I can't distinguish the power from the volume. Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good. Nice case. Fits perfectly and feels good in the hand. Much better grip for my phone.

Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good.  I really like it.  It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.  The hole cut to display the Motorola logo does help keep a handle on it, and I AM done looking for a case (now, after 3).  If you don't have chronic dry hands like I do, you probably won't have a problem at all with it.  Anyway, my only other complaint with this case (as it was with the previous 2 cases - both from Orzly) is that it's nearly impossible to find the power and volume buttons by feel alone.  If they could just put a little bump or line on the darn button, I would be so grateful. I really like it.

Did not give it 5 stars because the case gets dirty on the back throughout the day from setting it down and picking it up so I have to wipe it off. I do sometimes mistake the power key for the volume keys but overall it is a good case and seems to have good protection for the phone.

Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect  The case fits the phone very well, just as good as some of the more expensive brands like Bodyglove. The case should give enough protection for short falls but for larger ones may or may not be enough.  Fits well and does a great job protecting the phone but the case made the button hard to feel.

            "Would buy it if the item came in black.  cannot distinguish between volume and power buttons. such a cute color but  minimal coverage.  Bought this for the girlfriend's phone. She loves it, no complaints.  Fit perfect like a lot... Thanks  Great case for the price. Also was shipped pretty fast. That's was great since I just got my Nexus 6, didn't want to damage my phone in any way. Only thing is it is hard to tell what the buttons are on the side. Oh well gonna have to get use to it.  Nice case. Fits perfectly and feels good in the hand. Much better grip for my phone. The only thing that I can complain about is the buttons. I can't distinguish the power from the volume. Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good. Nice case. Fits perfectly and feels good in the hand. Much better grip for my phone.

Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good.  I really like it.  It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.  The hole cut to display the Motorola logo does help keep a handle on it, and I AM done looking for a case (now, after 3).  If you don't have chronic dry hands like I do, you probably won't have a problem at all with it.  Anyway, my only other complaint with this case (as it was with the previous 2 cases - both from Orzly) is that it's nearly impossible to find the power and volume buttons by feel alone.  If they could just put a little bump or line on the darn button, I would be so grateful. I really like it.

That's was great since I just got my Nexus 6, didn't want to damage my phone in any way. Only thing is it is hard to tell what the buttons are on the side. Oh well gonna have to get use to it.

Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good.  I really like it.  It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.  The hole cut to display the Motorola logo does help keep a handle on it, and I AM done looking for a case (now, after 3).  If you don't have chronic dry hands like I do, you probably won't have a problem at all with it.  Anyway, my only other complaint with this case (as it was with the previous 2 cases - both from Orzly) is that it's nearly impossible to find the power and volume buttons by feel alone.

Anyway, my only other complaint with this case (as it was with the previous 2 cases - both from Orzly) is that it's nearly impossible to find the power and volume buttons by feel alone.  If they could just put a little bump or line on the darn button, I would be so grateful. I really like it.  It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.

            "Would buy it if the item came in black.  cannot distinguish between volume and power buttons. such a cute color but  minimal coverage.  Bought this for the girlfriend's phone. She loves it, no complaints.  Fit perfect like a lot... Thanks  Great case for the price. Also was shipped pretty fast. That's was great since I just got my Nexus 6, didn't want to damage my phone in any way. Only thing is it is hard to tell what the buttons are on the side. Oh well gonna have to get use to it.  Nice case. Fits perfectly and feels good in the hand. Much better grip for my phone. The only thing that I can complain about is the buttons. I can't distinguish the power from the volume. Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good. Nice case. Fits perfectly and feels good in the hand. Much better grip for my phone.

Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good.  I really like it.  It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.  The hole cut to display the Motorola logo does help keep a handle on it, and I AM done looking for a case (now, after 3).  If you don't have chronic dry hands like I do, you probably won't have a problem at all with it.  Anyway, my only other complaint with this case (as it was with the previous 2 cases - both from Orzly) is that it's nearly impossible to find the power and volume buttons by feel alone.  If they could just put a little bump or line on the darn button, I would be so grateful. I really like it.

I saw some of the other reviews that said it gets stained easily and though \"I'm super clean, like obsessively clean, no way will I get the case stained\" I was wrong. I ordered this case two months ago and the case now looks gross.\n",

            "You can see in the pictures how dirty it now looks. The inside is still pretty and clean and the outside just looks dull and disgusting.  I have had the case for a few weeks now and I really like the color and feel of the case. The texture on the sides of the case helps avoid dropping the phone. Did not give it 5 stars because the case gets dirty on the back throughout the day from setting it down and picking it up so I have to wipe it off. I do sometimes mistake the power key for the volume keys but overall it is a good case and seems to have good protection for the phone.

Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect Perfect  The case fits the phone very well, just as good as some of the more expensive brands like Bodyglove. The case should give enough protection for short falls but for larger ones may or may not be enough.  Fits well and does a great job protecting the phone but the case made the button hard to feel.

            "Would buy it if the item came in black.  cannot distinguish between volume and power buttons. such a cute color but  minimal coverage.  Bought this for the girlfriend's phone. She loves it, no complaints.  Fit perfect like a lot... Thanks  Great case for the price. Also was shipped pretty fast. That's was great since I just got my Nexus 6, didn't want to damage my phone in any way. Only thing is it is hard to tell what the buttons are on the side. Oh well gonna have to get use to it.  Nice case. Fits perfectly and feels good in the hand. Much better grip for my phone. The only thing that I can complain about is the buttons. I can't distinguish the power from the volume.

Also I got the gray case and it was a lighter gray than the pictures but it still look good.  I really like it.  It looks great (IMO), but I really got this to help with the slipperiness of the Nexus 6; my hands are always dry and the Nexus 6 is REALLY hard to hold onto.  The sides of this case provide great traction, but the back is still more slippery than I would like.  If the finish was more glossy as opposed to the flat matte finish it has, I think it would be less slippery for those of us with dry hands.  The hole cut to display the Motorola logo does help keep a handle on it, and I AM done looking for a case (now, after 3).  If you don't have chronic dry hands like I do, you probably won't have a problem at all with it.  Anyway, my only other complaint with this case (as it was with the previous 2 cases - both from Orzly) is that it's nearly impossible to find the power and volume buttons by feel alone.  If they could just put a little bump or line on the darn button, I would be so grateful. I really like it.

It's several steps backwards as many very common droid features are missing. There are very few widgets; missing are calculator, a page of favorites for direct dial, clock widgets, WiFi widget, hot spot widget, and the list goes on. The Contacts area is complicated and virtually inoperable. Contacts will not sync with Facebook so photos of your friends will not appear. Every contact appears 4+ times and there is no fast way to link them, and linking them loses phone numbers. Terrible programming choices. Don't buy this phone.

Very good seller.  this really is a nice phone.  you can do so many things with it.  hands free features are great. has a rich red cover and a long battery life.

What can I say...this phone came to me virtually new. So far so good it is operating as it should with no problems at all. Very good seller.  this really is a nice phone.  you can do so many things with it.  hands free features are great. has a rich red cover and a long battery life.  I purchased mine used like new from Ecellular. Phone shipped same day as ordered and tracking number was for 2 day shipping. Arrived right on time and was free!\n",

Not a scratch or even a fingerprint to be found. It also had a dual USB Motorola wall charger and the most heavy duty USB cable I have seen in my life. Charger works flawlessly.\n",

The Contacts area is complicated and virtually inoperable. Contacts will not sync with Facebook so photos of your friends will not appear. Every contact appears 4+ times and there is no fast way to link them, and linking them loses phone numbers. Terrible programming choices. Don't buy this phone.

What can I say...this phone came to me virtually new. So far so good it is operating as it should with no problems at all. Very good seller.  this really is a nice phone.  you can do so many things with it.  hands free features are great. has a rich red cover and a long battery life.  I purchased mine used like new from Ecellular. Phone shipped same day as ordered and tracking number was for 2 day shipping. Arrived right on time and was free!\n",

            "I was not sure what to expect as to the condition. When I opened the box my jaw dropped. Securely nesteled in bubble rap was a perfect condition phone that looked brand new. Not a scratch or even a fingerprint to be found. It also had a dual USB Motorola wall charger and the most heavy duty USB cable I have seen in my life. Charger works flawlessly.\n",
            "\n",
            "The phone itself is locked to Verizon but you can use AT&T nano Sims in it for prepaid service. It is not guaranteed to work and neither Verizon, Motorola or AT&T will give you any support so try at your own risk.\n",

            "After 2 rather large updates the phone was upgraded to Android 4.4 kit Kat. I would expect a 4.4.2 update in the near future but all of my usual apps are working perfectly.\n",

            "It does not come with a nano Sim. I had to take it down to a local phone shop and get them to unlock it so I could use it on WiFi until my nano Sim comes in. It will not go past the activation screen without a special code. I could not find it online so I had to pay $5 to get it done at a local cell phone shop. This shouldn't be an issue for you unless you plan to use the phone before you activate it on a network.\n",
            "\n",
            "I am very happy with the display and the battery life. Storage is 11gb before the kit Kat update and 10.5 after. That is with all the stock apps updated that can not be removed. Luckily it supports USB OTG so it is easy enough to use external storage.\n",

This thing is indeed like new and at less than half the retail cost and the free shipping offer got the phone to me before seller even processed the order for my case!  Great phone.

I received this product thinking it would be cheap and low quality just like the other screen protectors I've tried in the past, but boy was I wrong. Nothing about the packaging or the screen protector was cheap. This tempered glass screen protector features a curved silver titanium alloy bezel (Also comes in Gold, Blue, Rose Red) which is absolutely beautiful on the Iphone 6. It also features the ballistic tempered glass with 9h hardness which is one of the hardest glasses available so you can be quite confident that it'll take the damage instead of your phone's screen. So far I've fallen in love with it; it compliments my silver Iphone 6 quite well.\n",

Love the full screen coverage but, if you are using a case that extends over the edges of your phone, the protector tends to lift at the edges at times.  Thank you  Would like a refun this screen protector works for a week or so the starts to peel up one star there is no negative stars if not i would give some negative stars  I LOVED this screen protector but unfortunately it's not compatible. ive found that the ones not compatible will cause apps to open and close on their own, make phone calls, and other random functions without you ever touching your screen.  The corner will not stay down. Very irritating. I'd like my money back. I've installed countless glass screen protectors and this type of protector with metal bezel never completely adhere to screen.  This is a very nice looking front glass protector. The flaws are you can only use select cases with it. I love to change cases out often for a different look so I only have 2 that will work with it (tight fit cases will not work). A tight case will push up the screen protector. The screen protector seems to be made for no case to be used.  The glass screen protector does not cover completely the curve screen of the phone (leaves a thin gap). The pluses are easy to put on, the top cuts are perfect, the gray metal looks good and adds that extra protection I need sometimes. This is a very nice looking front glass protector.

With this case, You have to release two clips at the top and slide your phone down into it. You then snap the top back on. Unlike other battery cases, this case had drop protection in mind as well as backup power. This made our iPhone 6+ a little bigger but not enough to stop me from using it.\n",

            "All of the buttons work very well with this case. It is a tad bit difficult to get to the mute switch, but that is not much different than other cases. The case provides a bit of protection from the elements, since the inlets for the headphones and power are sealed up with pull out tabs. I really like the corner protection that this battery case provided. It gives very springy cushion on all four corners.

            "When it comes to a battery charger case, there's no getting around the fact that it's going to add some bulk and some weight.  So, the first thing I look for in a case is how much it's able to minimize these two factors while still providing the charge that I'm seeking.  I'm happy to report that this case meets both criteria for me and does it in a more creative manner than most.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's talk weight first, remembering that when you add a battery to a case, you have to sacrifice some weight. It weighs just 3.2 ounces (the iPhone 6 itself weighs 4.55).  That's a lower weight than any battery case I've tested for the iPhone 6, many of which I liked very much.  And even though it's lighter weight, it does not sacrifice protection in the least, and in fact, I'd rate this one of the more protective battery cases I've seen.  Remembering that protection is a secondary function of a battery case and not a primary function generally, but we'll talk more about that in a bit.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, next we should talk about bulk.  I mentioned above that this case satisfies my personal requirement for minimal bulk and manages to do so creatively.  The fact is that at 0.62\" in width, it's technically thicker than many battery cases however, this is very well hidden in its design and the result is that it appears much thinner than it actually is.  There are two factors at play in the design that essentially draw the eyes away from its bulk.  First the back of the case is black with what looks like a brushed aluminum inlay.  Not only does this look really cool, but it has the effect of visually flattening the case.  The second part of the design that draws the eyes away is the flared corners.  Not only do they help to make the case appear thinner, but it also seems they would provide extra protection to the phone's corners.  I should also add that I really like the cutaway for the camera and flash which is cut at a right angle to the aluminum inlay and helps the case to look more stylish than most battery cases which tend to use a long oval.  If I had to describe the look of this case in one word, I'd probably say that it looks \"aggressive\".  So again, while the case is technically bulkier than some others, its style gives it a flattening appearance that will not leave you feeling like you've sacrificed in this area.  Remember, it's still lighter than many of the cases that are thinner.\n",

I have used several other cases, and this one is superior in several ways, especially in its ability to add some needed protection to the phone. With this case, You have to release two clips at the top and slide your phone down into it. You then snap the top back on. Unlike other battery cases, this case had drop protection in mind as well as backup power. This made our iPhone 6+ a little bigger but not enough to stop me from using it.\n",

            "All of the buttons work very well with this case. It is a tad bit difficult to get to the mute switch, but that is not much different than other cases. The case provides a bit of protection from the elements, since the inlets for the headphones and power are sealed up with pull out tabs.

I love these cases when I am on a trip or event that keeps me outdoors the entire day. Great quality.

            "When it comes to a battery charger case, there's no getting around the fact that it's going to add some bulk and some weight.  So, the first thing I look for in a case is how much it's able to minimize these two factors while still providing the charge that I'm seeking.  I'm happy to report that this case meets both criteria for me and does it in a more creative manner than most.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's talk weight first, remembering that when you add a battery to a case, you have to sacrifice some weight. It weighs just 3.2 ounces (the iPhone 6 itself weighs 4.55).  That's a lower weight than any battery case I've tested for the iPhone 6, many of which I liked very much.  And even though it's lighter weight, it does not sacrifice protection in the least, and in fact, I'd rate this one of the more protective battery cases I've seen.  Remembering that protection is a secondary function of a battery case and not a primary function generally, but we'll talk more about that in a bit.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, next we should talk about bulk.  I mentioned above that this case satisfies my personal requirement for minimal bulk and manages to do so creatively.  The fact is that at 0.62\" in width, it's technically thicker than many battery cases however, this is very well hidden in its design and the result is that it appears much thinner than it actually is.  There are two factors at play in the design that essentially draw the eyes away from its bulk.  First the back of the case is black with what looks like a brushed aluminum inlay.  Not only does this look really cool, but it has the effect of visually flattening the case.  The second part of the design that draws the eyes away is the flared corners.  Not only do they help to make the case appear thinner, but it also seems they would provide extra protection to the phone's corners.  I should also add that I really like the cutaway for the camera and flash which is cut at a right angle to the aluminum inlay and helps the case to look more stylish than most battery cases which tend to use a long oval.  If I had to describe the look of this case in one word, I'd probably say that it looks \"aggressive\".  So again, while the case is technically bulkier than some others, its style gives it a flattening appearance that will not leave you feeling like you've sacrificed in this area.  Remember, it's still lighter than many of the cases that are thinner.\n",

            "The case gives an excellent charge, completing its work in just about 2 hours.

So, using this case essentially doubles the life of your iPhone 6 which can be a life saver on intense usage days.\n",

            "The phone fits nicely and technically has 360 degree protection due to the front edge extending just slightly beyond the screen. Again, I don't believe protection is a main component of the case, but you're getting more protection than most battery cases offer. Buttons are protected with the exception of the mute button which is open for use.  The speakers/mic have outlets, and these (as with all battery cases) increase the length of the phone and so an audio jack extender is included.  Also included of course is your micro usb for charging and for data transfer.  This means that there is no function of your phone that will require you removing it from the case.\n",

It looks aggressive and modern and stands out in the area of design from any other battery case I've reviewed.  I don't hesitate to recommend it. Enjoy!  Great case for protection and charging my iPhone 6s  I love this case. I have been looking every where for a battery case, but i could never find the good quality, affordable one. I am really glad that I stumbled on this deal. Not only does it charge my phone on the go, this case also protects my phone well, so no need for two cases. I would like the case to look  a bit more chic but overall its a great case. I am very very happy with this case and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family.

            "suma:   This is one of the better iphone 6+ battery cases that I have had the opportunity to use. I have used several other cases, and this one is superior in several ways, especially in its ability to add some needed protection to the phone. With this case, You have to release two clips at the top and slide your phone down into it. You then snap the top back on. Unlike other battery cases, this case had drop protection in mind as well as backup power. This made our iPhone 6+ a little bigger but not enough to stop me from using it.\n",

            "All of the buttons work very well with this case. It is a tad bit difficult to get to the mute switch, but that is not much different than other cases. The case provides a bit of protection from the elements, since the inlets for the headphones and power are sealed up with pull out tabs. I really like the corner protection that this battery case provided. It gives very springy cushion on all four corners.

            "I received a discount for my honest and unbiased review of this battery case. It provides several recharges of the phones battery. This ability to recharge the battery several times, makes it the perfect case for those days were you use much more than the normal amounts of power. I love these cases when I am on a trip or event that keeps me outdoors the entire day. Great quality.  I want to let you know up front that I received a sample of this product free in exchange for an honest review.

            "When it comes to a battery charger case, there's no getting around the fact that it's going to add some bulk and some weight.  So, the first thing I look for in a case is how much it's able to minimize these two factors while still providing the charge that I'm seeking.  I'm happy to report that this case meets both criteria for me and does it in a more creative manner than most.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's talk weight first, remembering that when you add a battery to a case, you have to sacrifice some weight. It weighs just 3.2 ounces (the iPhone 6 itself weighs 4.55).  That's a lower weight than any battery case I've tested for the iPhone 6, many of which I liked very much.  And even though it's lighter weight, it does not sacrifice protection in the least, and in fact, I'd rate this one of the more protective battery cases I've seen.  Remembering that protection is a secondary function of a battery case and not a primary function generally, but we'll talk more about that in a bit.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, next we should talk about bulk.  I mentioned above that this case satisfies my personal requirement for minimal bulk and manages to do so creatively.  The fact is that at 0.62\" in width, it's technically thicker than many battery cases however, this is very well hidden in its design and the result is that it appears much thinner than it actually is.  There are two factors at play in the design that essentially draw the eyes away from its bulk.  First the back of the case is black with what looks like a brushed aluminum inlay.  Not only does this look really cool, but it has the effect of visually flattening the case.  The second part of the design that draws the eyes away is the flared corners.  Not only do they help to make the case appear thinner, but it also seems they would provide extra protection to the phone's corners.  I should also add that I really like the cutaway for the camera and flash which is cut at a right angle to the aluminum inlay and helps the case to look more stylish than most battery cases which tend to use a long oval.  If I had to describe the look of this case in one word, I'd probably say that it looks \"aggressive\".  So again, while the case is technically bulkier than some others, its style gives it a flattening appearance that will not leave you feeling like you've sacrificed in this area.  Remember, it's still lighter than many of the cases that are thinner.\n",
            "\n",
            "The case gives an excellent charge, completing its work in just about 2 hours. The power button is sleekly hidden on the lower portion of the back panel and there are 4 indicator lights that show you the unit's charge.  So, using this case essentially doubles the life of your iPhone 6 which can be a life saver on intense usage days.\n",
            "\n",
            "The phone fits nicely and technically has 360 degree protection due to the front edge extending just slightly beyond the screen. Again, I don't believe protection is a main component of the case, but you're getting more protection than most battery cases offer. Buttons are protected with the exception of the mute button which is open for use.  The speakers/mic have outlets, and these (as with all battery cases) increase the length of the phone and so an audio jack extender is included.  Also included of course is your micro usb for charging and for data transfer.  This means that there is no function of your phone that will require you removing it from the case.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bottom line: this is a really lightweight battery case with a unique, bulk hiding design.  It looks aggressive and modern and stands out in the area of design from any other battery case I've reviewed.  I don't hesitate to recommend it. Enjoy!  Great case for protection and charging my iPhone 6s  I love this case. I have been looking every where for a battery case, but i could never find the good quality, affordable one. I am really glad that I stumbled on this deal. Not only does it charge my phone on the go, this case also protects my phone well, so no need for two cases. I would like the case to look  a bit more chic but overall its a great case. I am very very happy with this case and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family.

I have used several other cases, and this one is superior in several ways, especially in its ability to add some needed protection to the phone. With this case, You have to release two clips at the top and slide your phone down into it. You then snap the top back on. Unlike other battery cases, this case had drop protection in mind as well as backup power. This made our iPhone 6+ a little bigger but not enough to stop me from using it.\n",

The case provides a bit of protection from the elements, since the inlets for the headphones and power are sealed up with pull out tabs.

            "When it comes to a battery charger case, there's no getting around the fact that it's going to add some bulk and some weight.  So, the first thing I look for in a case is how much it's able to minimize these two factors while still providing the charge that I'm seeking.  I'm happy to report that this case meets both criteria for me and does it in a more creative manner than most.\n",

            "Let's talk weight first, remembering that when you add a battery to a case, you have to sacrifice some weight. It weighs just 3.2 ounces (the iPhone 6 itself weighs 4.55).  That's a lower weight than any battery case I've tested for the iPhone 6, many of which I liked very much.  And even though it's lighter weight, it does not sacrifice protection in the least, and in fact, I'd rate this one of the more protective battery cases I've seen.  Remembering that protection is a secondary function of a battery case and not a primary function generally, but we'll talk more about that in a bit.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, next we should talk about bulk.  I mentioned above that this case satisfies my personal requirement for minimal bulk and manages to do so creatively.  The fact is that at 0.62\" in width, it's technically thicker than many battery cases however, this is very well hidden in its design and the result is that it appears much thinner than it actually is.  There are two factors at play in the design that essentially draw the eyes away from its bulk.  First the back of the case is black with what looks like a brushed aluminum inlay.  Not only does this look really cool, but it has the effect of visually flattening the case.  The second part of the design that draws the eyes away is the flared corners.  Not only do they help to make the case appear thinner, but it also seems they would provide extra protection to the phone's corners.  I should also add that I really like the cutaway for the camera and flash which is cut at a right angle to the aluminum inlay and helps the case to look more stylish than most battery cases which tend to use a long oval.  If I had to describe the look of this case in one word, I'd probably say that it looks \"aggressive\".  So again, while the case is technically bulkier than some others, its style gives it a flattening appearance that will not leave you feeling like you've sacrificed in this area.  Remember, it's still lighter than many of the cases that are thinner.\n",

Again, I don't believe protection is a main component of the case, but you're getting more protection than most battery cases offer. Buttons are protected with the exception of the mute button which is open for use.  The speakers/mic have outlets, and these (as with all battery cases) increase the length of the phone and so an audio jack extender is included.  Also included of course is your micro usb for charging and for data transfer.  This means that there is no function of your phone that will require you removing it from the case.\n",

Great case for protection and charging my iPhone 6s  I love this case. I have been looking every where for a battery case, but i could never find the good quality, affordable one. I am really glad that I stumbled on this deal. Not only does it charge my phone on the go, this case also protects my phone well, so no need for two cases.

            "suma:   This is one of the better iphone 6+ battery cases that I have had the opportunity to use. I have used several other cases, and this one is superior in several ways, especially in its ability to add some needed protection to the phone. With this case, You have to release two clips at the top and slide your phone down into it. You then snap the top back on. Unlike other battery cases, this case had drop protection in mind as well as backup power. This made our iPhone 6+ a little bigger but not enough to stop me from using it.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of the buttons work very well with this case. It is a tad bit difficult to get to the mute switch, but that is not much different than other cases. The case provides a bit of protection from the elements, since the inlets for the headphones and power are sealed up with pull out tabs. I really like the corner protection that this battery case provided. It gives very springy cushion on all four corners. In my opinion the case adds to the overall look of the phone which is always a bonus.\n",
            "\n",
            "I received a discount for my honest and unbiased review of this battery case. It provides several recharges of the phones battery. This ability to recharge the battery several times, makes it the perfect case for those days were you use much more than the normal amounts of power. I love these cases when I am on a trip or event that keeps me outdoors the entire day. Great quality.  I want to let you know up front that I received a sample of this product free in exchange for an honest review.  I hope that my observations and experience with the product will be of some assistance to you in your decision making process.\n",
            "\n",
            "When it comes to a battery charger case, there's no getting around the fact that it's going to add some bulk and some weight.  So, the first thing I look for in a case is how much it's able to minimize these two factors while still providing the charge that I'm seeking.  I'm happy to report that this case meets both criteria for me and does it in a more creative manner than most.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's talk weight first, remembering that when you add a battery to a case, you have to sacrifice some weight. It weighs just 3.2 ounces (the iPhone 6 itself weighs 4.55).  That's a lower weight than any battery case I've tested for the iPhone 6, many of which I liked very much.  And even though it's lighter weight, it does not sacrifice protection in the least, and in fact, I'd rate this one of the more protective battery cases I've seen.  Remembering that protection is a secondary function of a battery case and not a primary function generally, but we'll talk more about that in a bit.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, next we should talk about bulk.  I mentioned above that this case satisfies my personal requirement for minimal bulk and manages to do so creatively.  The fact is that at 0.62\" in width, it's technically thicker than many battery cases however, this is very well hidden in its design and the result is that it appears much thinner than it actually is.  There are two factors at play in the design that essentially draw the eyes away from its bulk.  First the back of the case is black with what looks like a brushed aluminum inlay.  Not only does this look really cool, but it has the effect of visually flattening the case.  The second part of the design that draws the eyes away is the flared corners.  Not only do they help to make the case appear thinner, but it also seems they would provide extra protection to the phone's corners.  I should also add that I really like the cutaway for the camera and flash which is cut at a right angle to the aluminum inlay and helps the case to look more stylish than most battery cases which tend to use a long oval.  If I had to describe the look of this case in one word, I'd probably say that it looks \"aggressive\".  So again, while the case is technically bulkier than some others, its style gives it a flattening appearance that will not leave you feeling like you've sacrificed in this area.  Remember, it's still lighter than many of the cases that are thinner.\n",
            "\n",
            "The case gives an excellent charge, completing its work in just about 2 hours. The power button is sleekly hidden on the lower portion of the back panel and there are 4 indicator lights that show you the unit's charge.  So, using this case essentially doubles the life of your iPhone 6 which can be a life saver on intense usage days.\n",
            "\n",
            "The phone fits nicely and technically has 360 degree protection due to the front edge extending just slightly beyond the screen. Again, I don't believe protection is a main component of the case, but you're getting more protection than most battery cases offer. Buttons are protected with the exception of the mute button which is open for use.  The speakers/mic have outlets, and these (as with all battery cases) increase the length of the phone and so an audio jack extender is included.  Also included of course is your micro usb for charging and for data transfer.  This means that there is no function of your phone that will require you removing it from the case.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bottom line: this is a really lightweight battery case with a unique, bulk hiding design.  It looks aggressive and modern and stands out in the area of design from any other battery case I've reviewed.  I don't hesitate to recommend it. Enjoy!  Great case for protection and charging my iPhone 6s  I love this case. I have been looking every where for a battery case, but i could never find the good quality, affordable one. I am really glad that I stumbled on this deal. Not only does it charge my phone on the go, this case also protects my phone well, so no need for two cases. I would like the case to look  a bit more chic but overall its a great case. I am very very happy with this case and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family. I really do love this case. I received this case at a discounted price in exchange for my willingness to give a honest and unbiased review.  Love it.  Works great.  Long added life to the battery and iphone  We tested this very attractive case on an iPhone5s.  It charges quickly and it is easy to install it on the phone.  Once it is in place, it's simple to use it as a back-up battery.  All of the features of the phone are readily accessible with the cover in place and it adds very little to the weight or bulk. It provides some protection to the back and sides of the phone.

            "suma:   I have been buying a Diztronic case for every iphone since my 4, and the one for the 7 is not the same. There is no longer the nice protective lip protecting it from putting your phone face down. Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

This brand and seller were a find  Horrible case offers no protection and barely fits the phone  Great case. Love it. I will buy more :)  I have used Diztronic for years, as they combine lo-profile, minimalism and cheap into one fantastic package every time!\n",
            "\n",
            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.

            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

I will buy more :)  I have used Diztronic for years, as they combine lo-profile, minimalism and cheap into one fantastic package every time!\n",

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.

Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.

            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

I will buy more :)  I have used Diztronic for years, as they combine lo-profile, minimalism and cheap into one fantastic package every time!\n",
            "\n",
            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.

Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.

            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.

Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

I will buy more :)  I have used Diztronic for years, as they combine lo-profile, minimalism and cheap into one fantastic package every time!\n",

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.

            "suma:   I have been buying a Diztronic case for every iphone since my 4, and the one for the 7 is not the same. There is no longer the nice protective lip protecting it from putting your phone face down. Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

This brand and seller were a find  Horrible case offers no protection and barely fits the phone  Great case. Love it. I will buy more :)  I have used Diztronic for years, as they combine lo-profile, minimalism and cheap into one fantastic package every time!\n",
            "\n",
            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

            "suma:   I have been buying a Diztronic case for every iphone since my 4, and the one for the 7 is not the same. There is no longer the nice protective lip protecting it from putting your phone face down. Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

            "suma:   I have been buying a Diztronic case for every iphone since my 4, and the one for the 7 is not the same. There is no longer the nice protective lip protecting it from putting your phone face down. Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

I will buy more :)  I have used Diztronic for years, as they combine lo-profile, minimalism and cheap into one fantastic package every time!\n",
            "\n",
            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.

This brand and seller were a find  Horrible case offers no protection and barely fits the phone  Great case. Love it. I will buy more :)  I have used Diztronic for years, as they combine lo-profile, minimalism and cheap into one fantastic package every time!\n",

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.

            "suma:   I have been buying a Diztronic case for every iphone since my 4, and the one for the 7 is not the same.

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.

I will buy more :)  I have used Diztronic for years, as they combine lo-profile, minimalism and cheap into one fantastic package every time!\n",

            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",

            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.

            "suma:   I have been buying a Diztronic case for every iphone since my 4, and the one for the 7 is not the same. There is no longer the nice protective lip protecting it from putting your phone face down. Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.

Also, no longer does it have the \"grippy\" feel and unfortunately it's much too slippery and increase chance of damage if dropped.  Soft material, fit very slim and has a good grip. Like most Diztronic cases, I recommend it. Had it for most of my phones.  The case arrived on time and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I have to give just 2 stars. The color is MUCH darker then in the photo and the case is very slippery. I really don't feel a good grip and I still worry about dropping my phone. I'm already searching for a different case.\n",
            "I read a lot of reviews and all were great, praising the case how durable it is and that it has a great grip. None for me. It is really slim, doesn't make my brand new, precious phone bulky, but I don't feel the protection...\n",
            "I'm sorry, but this is really not what I expected.  Great fit. Diztronic products always work well with iPhones I have. Nice layer of extra protection, but not bulky. The only downside is it has the logo on the inside which may rub off onto the phone when it runs hot.  Good looking design. Nice look and feel on the back side. Does not add much thickness to phone. Only thing is, it feels little slippery when holding in hands.  A good slimline case with a nice lightly rubberized feel.  Not a great drop-protection case, but it seems to do the job reasonably well.  If you're looking for something minimalistic but good, this one is a go. My only issue is fingerprints.  I love the texture.  This case is as described. Its a good quality. Hard and fits the iPhone perfectly. I am very happy with it.  I have always used these type of silicon cases, they are stiff enough to protect, but flexible enough to easily get the phone in and out.  I liked this design because it covers the lower front edge of the phone (many other cases are copying Apple's cases that just cover the front corner.  Fit and finish on the case is excellent, and everything lines up well.  It's also not very tacky-feeling, you can still grip the phone better with the case, but it's easy to get in and out of a jeans pocket. Doesn't add much bulk to the phone at all.

I will buy more :)  I have used Diztronic for years, as they combine lo-profile, minimalism and cheap into one fantastic package every time!\n",
            "\n",
            "Well...almost every time- Don't get me wring this case is great, but with 1 small design flaw. it an attempt to follow the slim-line style of the 7/8 they neglected to make the piece of the case that accepts the lightening charger open enough to fit the charging end.  Really like this case. Got the textured one and it fells great.  When it arrived, the package was cut at the top.  When I looked at the unit, there were some small marks on the back.  It was obviously take out of the package and used.  There was no damage to the case, so it isn't worth the hassle of returning it and waiting for another.  But it does knock a couple of stars off of a great case.  I have bought a lot of phone cases from Diztronic, and they have always worked great and have a low profile.  This is the first one I have gotten that wasn't brand new.  Hopefully this was a fluke, and I am the only person who doesn't get a brand new one.  Nice matte finish compliments my iphone 7 matte black perfectly.  Slim with nice protection.  My go to case now.  The color and the smoothness is so good. Let's see how long it goes.  Hands down best slim case. That's why I keep buying them.  I use this brand every time I buy a new phone. I drop my phone all the time and no cracked screen yet. 3 phones and counting...that can't be luck  This is my third Diztronic case.  I've owned their cases for iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 and sought out Diztronic specifically for my iPhone 7 case.  Because i knew that i would not be disappointed with the build quality (over ordering from some random no-name maker).  This is very much a no-frills case, i won't hold credit cards, it does not have a stand, there's not 30+ color choices, and there's no cut out to show the Apple logo (who cares, right?).  What it does feature is a solidly built, TPM based case that feels good in your hand and looks great.  It's not slick or slippery.  The thin bezel will not interfere with your screen protector, and the raised edge protects your screen from damage should you drop your phone face-front.  The new button design makes it easier to press the physical buttons on your phone, great new feature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pro tip:  Fold a 20 dollar bill into thirds and place it between your phone and this case for emergency cash.  Not needed so much with Apple Pay, but still handy where that's not accepted.  Awesome case if you want good protection without the bulk. I had this case for the 6S and loved it so I got it for the 7. The 7 seems to have made it ever slightly thinner on the face, which was my only complaint about the 6S version. One of the best overall cases I have had.  nice slim case. I have had some version of a Diztronic case for all of my phones and each has done a great job protecting the phone from drops, while not adding too much to the thickness. This one is no different.  This case gives the iPhone a great grip. It's also durable and built to last years.  My second Diztronic case. They are the best.  Perfect fit for my new phone, all ports accessible, bright red color-love it!  Gets scratches and scuff marks from normal use in less than 2 days.\n",

I did not contact the company so I can't tell you about their customer service.  As expected.  So far this holder stays put on windshield. It will not stay ON dash due to plastic type material. An FYI: I PURCHASED for my Galaxy S4, & it just fits, no room to spare. (However it fits with my protective case on this phone ). So far good product I reccomend!!  I was a little hesitant at first because I wasn't sure it would fit my Galaxy II cellphone. It works great even with the case on my phone. Delivery was very quick. \"  I am really happy with the quality of my cell windshield holder, its just the right size under the rearview mirror.  I would give seller more stars but 5--for perfect. Delivery was fast... I am happy.  I recently took this on a trip to Atlanta and it worked GREAT! Very sturdy, great suction, and it securely holds my iPhone 5S even with a case on it. I love the way it pops into place and grips the phone really tightly. The release buttons on the side are super easy too.

The touch is very smooth and no smudges on the screen. I do have to wipe the screen a little, but It's tempered glass and you're gonna have some fingerprints especially if your fingers have any kind of grime on them. This is a good product\n",

            "[commMgrTok:A3CA0QZ5PEVDBK]  Bought two of these (one for myself and one for my father) and we both use it on a daily basis. Great for the Samsung S3 or an iPhone :-) I even use it for my original iPod touch for when I'm listening while driving around!  Poor quality, broke after a month of careful operation. I do not recommend this product.  The mount works perfectly on my windshield, not quite so much on my dashboard but is because of an issue with my dashboard and not the product in question. The suction is quite powerful on it, I was able to lift my dining room table with the mount, so I have no fears of the mount failing while I am driving.  I bought this unit to replace a rather flimsy one that would no longer grab the phone properly. This looks sturdier and better designed. I am looking forward to testing it more thoroughly.\"  I've only used this mount for about two weeks now, but so far it works great. Easily holds my iPhone with the case and it's easy to remove and install the phone at any given time. Would highly recommend this product!  I ordered this mainly because of the low price point.\n",
            "The next day I took a ride with my dad and watched him struggle with his. His didn't adjust easily and was alternately too tight to adjust and too loose to hold. I worried that I had made a mistake buying at this price point since his was like $40.\n",
            "Now that I've used it, I really like this mount. This is the first time I've used one so I can't really make comparisons.\n",
            "It mounted to the windshield easily, adjusted easily, and grips my phone nice and tight.\n",
            "I finally got my first taste of being able to use a phone as a GPS and it worked great.\n",
            "This mount is cheap and awesome.  Have had problem with the GPS windshield staying in place. No more problem. I am soon to order one more.  After reading the reviews I thought that this was going to be a great product that I would have no trouble setting up in my car. So far I haven't been able to get it to stay in place anywhere. I've attempted to place it on the dash and on the window but it won't stay. In the interest of full disclosure, I haven't spent a lot of time trying, but I shouldn't have to!\n",
            "\n",
            "EDITED: I tried this set up again and am able to get it to hold for now, so I've improved my review. If it holds it will be a great device -- it is easy to get my phone into and out of the cradle.  The product is very well made especially for the cost.  The one thing I did not like was the fact that I can only stick it to glass since the sticker that usually comes with these kind of holders was not included in the packaging.  I did not contact the company so I can't tell you about their customer service.  As expected.  So far this holder stays put on windshield. It will not stay ON dash due to plastic type material. An FYI: I PURCHASED for my Galaxy S4, & it just fits, no room to spare. (However it fits with my protective case on this phone ). So far good product I reccomend!!  I was a little hesitant at first because I wasn't sure it would fit my Galaxy II cellphone. It works great even with the case on my phone. Delivery was very quick. \"  I am really happy with the quality of my cell windshield holder, its just the right size under the rearview mirror.  I would give seller more stars but 5--for perfect. Delivery was fast... I am happy.  I recently took this on a trip to Atlanta and it worked GREAT! Very sturdy, great suction, and it securely holds my iPhone 5S even with a case on it. I love the way it pops into place and grips the phone really tightly. The release buttons on the side are super easy too. I read all the customer reviews first before purchasing and am so glad I decided on THIS particular mount. It had a 5-star rating and it was less than $20!\n",
